          <p>Personal injury &amp; compensation law covers legal matters that arise when an injury (physical and
            / or psychological) has happened to you or a loved one. You can seek compensation from the
            person, people, or organisation responsible for your injury.</p>


          <Typography variant="p"
sx={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Because of the broad nature of personal injuries, they are subdivided into smaller legal
            categories for example:</Typography>
          <ul>
            <li> Work-related injuries or injuries resulting from commuting to work
            </li><li> Motor vehicle accidents
            </li><li> Injuries resulting from crime/assault including sexual assault
            </li><li> Injuries resulting from the use of public spaces e.g., shopping centres
            </li><li> Injuries arising from product defects</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Due to the variety in personal injuries and the fact that each State or Territory in Australia has
            different requirements from proving a claim and doling compensation it is recommended that
            before you go out and pursue your claim you first consult with a specialised lawyer. Tell us where
            you are and what you need and Advocat will find the right specialist lawyer for your

              The Civil Liability Act, established in 2003, places upper limits on the maximum amount of
              compensation that will be awarded for the different aspects of your claim, such as claiming for
              non-monetary or punitive damages, e.g., psychological trauma or loss of quality of life.

              There is also a time limit over which you can claim against the responsible party. However, the
              time limits vary from case to case and are dependent on factors such as, the necessity or
              urgency to claim based on medical issues. For this reason, you should open your claim as soon
              after your injury as you can.

              <p>Any person who has been injured within Australia, as the result of another partyâ€™s negligence
                can claim for compensation.</p>
              <p>This includes being injured in a motor vehicle accident by a licensed vehicle or if you are a
                dependent of the individual who was injured. Any form of personal injury can be claimed for,
                provided it can be shown that the cause was directly due to another&apos;s negligence or action.
                Instances of criminal assaults or injury arising from criminal action, your claim will be against
                particular parties or persons. For example, if a person unlawfully enters your house and assaults
                you, you can claim for the subsequent medical fees incurred as well as open a case of criminal
                assault.</p>

              The claims process does not happen overnight. It can take from 6 to 12 months before you will
              be compensated. The best way to initiate the claims process is to begin by consulting a
              specialist personal injury lawyer to verify the validity of your claim. Most law firms offer a free
              first consultation, during which your case will be determined, and you will be advised on how to
              proceed. Your lawyer will go through the arduous process of collecting all the documents,
              medical reports and statements on your behalf and make sure that your claim is lodged through
              the proper channels.
